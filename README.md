## 🔍 Why Made This Website

---
Stony Brook University has a website called Course Evaluation. It shows the average study time or difficulty based on the overall grade distribution data and students' opinions for each course.

**However**, above site only provides information for the specific course in the current semester and does not offer comprehensive information.

Therefore, in order for students to have a more comprehensive understanding of the difficulty level of each course, I created the Find Easy A website.
